===========================

This set of Python modules is sufficient to generate and plot histograms of precipitation amounts on any input timescale and horizontal grid.

The code uses either kg m-2 day-1 or mm day-1 as the unit for precipitation throughout. Input datasets on other timescales are converted to kg m-2 day-1 or mm day-1 using Iris method convert_units, provided their input units are specified and are in the same form. 

Datasets of accumulated rainfall over specified time periods must include the accumulation time as part of the unit otherwise convert_units will fail. For example, 3-hourly accumulations must be labelled in mm 3h-1 or kg m-2 3h-1 and not just mm or kg m-2.

NOTE that plots are labelled with "mm/day" although it is recognised that this assumes water density = 1 kg m-3.

The method uses 100 bins whose limits are defined thus:

    >>> bin=np.zeros(100)
    >>> bin[1:]=bin2[0:99]
    >>> bin2=np.exp(np.log(0.005)+np.sqrt(np.linspace(0,98,99)*((np.square(np.log(120.)-np.log(0.005)))/59.)))

This samples rainfall intensities in the range 0.005 to 2209 mm/day. Counts of values into element [i] of the output histogram are made such that pbin[i] <= values < pbin[i+1]. Any values larger(smaller) than that are all lumped into the 100th(first) bin.

Note that this implies that the histogram of events will sum to total no. of intervals in sample.

Histogram counts can be converted to actual and fractional rainfall contributions using:

* Average rain in box over sample = sum over bins(no. events x avg. ppn rate in bin) / (no of intervals in sample)
* Contribution of average rainfall by events in bin (in mm/day) = (no. of events x avg. ppn rate in bin in mm/day)/(no of intervals in sample)
* Fractional contribution = Actual contribution / Average rain in box over sample

By calculating these contributions at many grid-boxes in a region, we can produce maps of the contributions of various precipitation intensity bins to the total precipitation at each grid-box. 

Regional averages of the spectra can also be produced for direct comparison between datasets. This is done by averaging together the histograms calculated at each point in the region, NOT by creating a new histogram using all the points within the region (doing the latter would remove some of the effects of grid-scale temporal variability (as it may be raining at one point when it is not at another), which is what this analysis method was designed to investigate).

Regional averages are included for easier comparison between timescales and datasets, but since they do introduce spatial averaging, they are best done for relatively small (or spatially-consistent) regions only.

Tests
=====

The set of tests is designed to check that the code produces identical results ot the sample files included in the package. This can be used to check whether any changes made have altered the functionality. The test package: 

* Uses test input dataset (a random distribution of "rainfall" data). 
* Generates histogram counts and saves as netCDF file. Should be identical to sample histogram dataset supplied.
* Checks that the fractional contributions sum to 1.0 at all points

Files supplied (in reference subdirectory):

* test_precipitation_dataset.nc : input artifical rainfall dataset (mm/day)
* test_precipitation_hist.nc : output file of histogram counts
* test_precipitation_histmap_act.png : map of actual rainfall contributions
* test_precipitation_histmap_frac.png : map of fractional rainfall contributions
* test_hist1d_act.png : 1D histogram of actual rainfall contributions for sub-region (215E - 225E, 5S - 5N)
* test_hist1d_frac.png : 1D histogram of fractional rainfall contributions for sub-region (215E - 225E, 5S - 5N)

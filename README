Diagnostics from the CSSP Brazil DUBSTEP project on sub-seasonal rainfall

=====
First study of Matt's scripts:
There are three master scripts:
	save_weekly_forecasts_ukmo_ncep.py
	save_weekly_forecasts_ecmf.py
	analyse_weekly_forecasts_final.py

Suggestion: start with the ukmo data sorting
		do not go too deep, take a look how data is used in analysis
